            <h2>About the Dev</h2>
            <p>
            Permit me the honour of a brief introduction. I am Joy, a devoted craftswoman of the web, equally enchanted by the elegance of front-end design and the integrity of back-end logic. Schooled in both the structure of data and the art of user experience, I seek always to weave clarity, purpose, and grace into every line of code I commit.
            </p>
            <p>
            With a passion for innovation and a fondness for refinement, I take great delight in creating digital experiences that are both beautiful and functional—where form meets function in the most dignified manner.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>My academic journey began at the esteemed Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, where I presently pursue a Bachelor of Science in Geospatial Information Science. A curriculum rich in spatial understanding, data visualization, and geospatial web technologies.</p>

        <p>Further refinement of my craft took place at EMobilis Technology Institute and through the Power Learn Project, where I was schooled in the modern dialects of the web: Python, Django, and the Bootstrap framework, all under a banner of collaboration and mentorship.</p>

        <p>I have also acquired special distinction in modern geospatial technologies through Esri’s MOOC, and currently attend a Django REST API bootcamp—my latest intellectual promenade.</p>
