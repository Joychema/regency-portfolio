# 🎀 Joy | A Lady of Code, Elegance, and Purpose

Welcome to my personal portfolio, crafted with grace, wit, and a touch of Regency flair. This project was lovingly built for the **PLP Academy Hackathon – July 2025 Cohort**, following the challenge to showcase one's digital debut using only **HTML5 and CSS3**.

> *"Permit me the honour of a brief introduction. I am Joy, a humble craftswoman of the web, equally enchanted by the elegance of front-end design and the rigour of back-end architecture."*
